# Welcome to Conquest: World War Simulator!

This file will give you the run down on the project, for people who remix the project or any developers i hire, if i decide to.

### GeoJSON, TopoJSON, and JSON files

`capitals.geojson.json` - GeoJSON file, contains the data for all the capitals of the countries.

`countries-land-10km.geo.json` - GeoJSON file, contains the data for the land of the countries.

`land-50m.json` - TopoJSON file, contains the land files for the map, not the countries. This file is not in use yet.

`countries.json` - JSON file, contains the military, economy, population, and color data for the countries.

`formables.json` - JSON file, contains formable data.

### Javascript files

`phaser.js` - Contains all the game code.

`script.js` - Purely contains the code for the play button (stupid, i know).

`selectcountry.js` - Contains the code for country selection.

### HTML files

`index.html` - Contains HTML for the start screen.

`selectcountry.html` - Contains HTML for the selectcountry screen.

`game.html` - Contains HTML for the game.

### CSS files

`style.css` - Styles the game. What did you think it did?

### Other things i felt were important enough to explicitly mention

**_vConsole:_** Virtual console for debugging. You can use this for debugging if you don't have the developer console (i.e, your school or workplace doesn't allow you to use it.).

# Have fun, and I wish you the best with whatever you wanna do with my code (except steal it, please don't do that).
