# What are development statuses?

Development statuses show whether or not the game is being worked on and to what extent. Here they are:

`Halted` - Development work has stopped permanently and will likely not continue.

`Paused` - Development work has stopped with intent to continue.

`Active` - Development work is ongoing.

### Development substatuses

Development substatuses provide more insight on the development status. You'll see them listed like this:

`Active,` *<-- this is the status!* `limited` *<-- this is the substatus!*

Here they are:

`Limited` - Limited capacity.

`Normal` - No special substatus.

`Immenent Halt`, `Immenent Pause`, `Immenent Resume` - These are self-explanatory.

`Temporary` - Indicates a temporary status.

**There can be more than one substatus!**
